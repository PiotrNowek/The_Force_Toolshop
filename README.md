## About the Author

I'm a budding programmer embarking on this interstellar journey of testing. With a passion for learning and a drive to master the art of coding, I'm excited to contribute to the galaxy of Toolshop. Together, we'll explore the farthest reaches of the API and UI universe and ensure that no bug escapes our vigilant watch.
